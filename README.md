This project aims to create a product that can detects objects on supermarket shelves and highlight the specific product you are looking for.

The first step was to isolate the products on shelves which is done using object detection from the YOLOv8 model. The model was trained on the [Supermarket Shelves Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/humansintheloop/supermarket-shelves-dataset/data)  found from Kaggle.
